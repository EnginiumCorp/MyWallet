# MyWallet
Looking for android app testers!

Hello fellow Devs! I am currently developing my first app "MyWallet" (for now just for Android) where users can simply track their balance. As a student I nver found the right app that suited to my requirements so I decided to dive into the App development. 
Now the app is in Closed Alpha, and I need at least 20 users that use the app for 14 days straight to proceed to app Publication. 
To help me reach the next step you can contact me on enginiumcorp@gmail.com where you can tell me your mail so that I can give you access to the Alpha!!
